      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a senior-level Human Resources leader with over 14 years of experience shaping people strategy, driving compliance, and leading employee-centered operations. From managing entire HR departments to implementing new HRIS systems and leading volunteer programs with hundreds of individuals, Iâ€™ve worn every HR hat and built a reputation for thoughtful, efficient, and human-first leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of my career, Iâ€™ve consistently taken on high-impact projectsâ€”negotiating lower pricing for HR software to save budgets, leading major transitions between payroll and benefits vendors, and helping organizations modernize outdated systems. Iâ€™ve also worked closely with managers and frontline employees to navigate complex issues in a respectful, clear, and collaborative way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, Iâ€™m expanding my skill set into front-end development. Iâ€™ve always believed that technology should serve peopleâ€”especially in HRâ€”and Iâ€™m interested in building digital tools that are accessible, inclusive, and genuinely helpful for teams. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m currently completing the <strong>Front-End Developer</strong> career path at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. Iâ€™m learning to create beautiful, responsive websites and applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to combine my HR expertise with strong technical skills to work on internal tools, compliance dashboards, onboarding platforms, or anything else that helps organizations work smarter and support their teams better.

        <h3>SourcePoint (2025)</h3>
        <p>
          I led both the HR and Volunteer departments, managing the full employee lifecycle, payroll, benefits, and compliance for a nonprofit organization. I implemented new Paylocity modules to improve hiring and performance tracking, negotiated cost savings, and mentored a new HR Generalist. I also oversaw a volunteer base of over 500 individuals, supporting program coordination and community engagement.

        <h3>Columbus Colony for Elderly Care (2024)</h3>
        <p>
          I served as HR Director for a unique long-term care facility supporting Deaf and DeafBlind residents.

        <h3>ScriptDrop, Inc. (2021â€“2023)</h3>
        <p>
          As a remote HR Generalist at this health tech company, I implemented Paylocity, redesigned onboarding, and created recurring reports to monitor data quality, compliance, and headcount trends. I also led new hire orientations, coordinated benefit enrollments, and handled payroll and employee questions directly in a high-growth, fast-paced environment.

      <article>
        <h3>Coughlin Automotive (2011â€“2021)</h3>
        <p>
          I supported 15+ tax IDs across HRIS, benefits, and payroll transitions, moving teams from paper-based processes to modern platforms including ADP and Paylocity. I oversaw open enrollments for hundreds of employees, managed all onboarding/offboarding, processed payroll, and led compliance programs including FMLA, workers' compensation, and unemployment claims.

      <article>
        <h3>Random Acts (Volunteer, 2019â€“2021)</h3>
        <p>
          I led a team of volunteer HR coordinators in improving onboarding and retention, increasing new hire volunteer retention by 30%. I developed onboarding packets and led training initiativesâ€”all while ensuring a positive and supportive culture in a fully remote nonprofit setting.

      <h2>Front-End Development Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m currently completing Codecademyâ€™s Front-End Developer career path, which covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, accessibility, and responsive design. Iâ€™ve built static and interactive pages, practiced DOM manipulation, and learned how to organize and version-control projects using GitHub.
      </p>
      <p>
        My learning focus includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Writing clean, semantic HTML5</li>
        <li>Building responsive layouts with Flexbox and Grid</li>
        <li>Creating dynamic functionality with JavaScript</li>
        <li>Practicing accessibility and mobile-first design principles</li>
        <li>Using GitHub for collaborative, trackable version control</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m currently working on a few personal projects to showcase both HR process automation ideas and clean front-end design. I'm also exploring opportunities to contribute to open source and nonprofit web projects that improve access and usability.
